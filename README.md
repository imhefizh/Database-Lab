Everyone knows digital world can't be seperated from data, so everything has it database to keep the information of the system. Here I am, deepen my understanding by practicing Database Engineering to complete my understanding as `Software Engineer`.

For world where data transaction and manipulation are going so fast, I'll be using Relational Database. I am using mySQL rn, gonna try PostgreSQL later. Sometimes I do Non-Relational Database as well with MongoDB, with some reason.
